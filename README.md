# SortManager
A sort manager project where the user is prompted to enter which of the 6 types of sorts they would like to use on a randomised array (BubbleSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, SelectionSort, BinaryTreeSort). The user will then enter the length of the array for the chosen sorter. Also, contains an binary tree interface to add further methods.
